To get everything compiling you'll need:


For the general micro c# stuff for the managed fez domino code:
Visual Studio 2010 (earlier might work?)

Microsoft .NET Micro Framework 4.1 SDK 
	http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&id=8515
	
GHI NETMF v4.1 and .NET Gadgeteer Package
	http://www.ghielectronics.com/downloads/NETMF/GHI%20NETMF%20v4.1%20and%20.NET%20Gadgeteer%20Package.zip
	
RLP code compilation:
both from http://www.yagarto.de/:
	YAGARTO Tools
	 YAGARTO GNU ARM toolchain (in this order)
	 
python (tested with 2.7, but will likely work with other versions)
	not completely neccessary, i just used it to generate the 
	sin table and analyze the space remaining on the device.
	Without python, you'll get a bunch of errors in the build script, but it'll still work.
	Just don't try to change the size of the sin table
